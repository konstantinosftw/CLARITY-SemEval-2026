    "question": "\nQ. Of the Biden administration. And accused the United States of containing China while pushing for diplomatic talks.\nHow would you respond to that? And do you think President Xi is being sincere about getting the relationship back on track as he bans Apple in China?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. Well, look, first of all, the\u2014I am sincere about getting the relationship right. And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.\nAnd so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chinese\u2014no one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.\nAnd so, really, what this trip was about\u2014it was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.\nAnd I think that one of the things we've done\u2014I've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 months\u2014is, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.\nThat's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.\nAnd it's\u2014for example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doing\u2014why was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, \"To maintain stability.\" It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the road\u2014everything from airspace and space in the ocean is\u2014the international rules of the road are abided by.\nAnd so\u2014and I hope that\u2014I think that Prime Minister Xi\u2014I mean, Xi has some\u2014some difficulties right now. All countries end up with difficulties, and he had some economic difficulties he's working his way through. I want to see China succeed economically, but I want to see them succeed by the rules.\nThe next question was to Bloomberg.\nChina/Taiwan/U.S. Export Controls  ",

    "question": "\nQ. Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you stated that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?\nAnd also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?\nAnd now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars\u2014and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would\u2014what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?\nLastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.\nHowever, there are still concerns that the\u2014Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Yoon. First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.\nFor instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women\u2014across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.\nSuch comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.\nSo that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.\nAnd at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.\nOur three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits\u2014tangible benefits\u2014to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.\nBut what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. \nPresident Biden. I\u2014look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.\nWe know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.\nAnd there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.\nAnd by the way, one of the things we get asked many times\u2014and it wasn't directly asked, but implied\u2014is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?\nThink about\u2014as students of history, all of you; and you are\u2014think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.\nAnd so I just think this is a\u2014we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.\nPrime Minister Kishida. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with President Yoon. The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.\nThis year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings\u2014we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.\nEconomic security dialogue was started\u2014or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.\nAnd so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.\nGoing forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with\u2014along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nThen, let me see. From Kyodo\u2014Tajiri-san, Kyodo News.\nUkraine/Russia/Japan/Indo-Pacific Region  ",

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a moment ago about what you won't do in terms of your negotiations with Republicans. But I'm interested in what you've signaled you already might do. In particular, by conceding in these negotiations to some form of a cap or freezing spending, are you concerned that Mr. McCarthy has already forced you into accepting a policy position that could tip this economy into a recession?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. No, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told you\u2014and you may be aware or you've seen it\u2014we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.\nAnd secondly, we're in a situation where the\u2014let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, \"Okay, we have to make some cuts,\" would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income\u2014what was coming in the door\u2014to determine what you could afford?\nAnd so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as\u2014as well as\u2014cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.\nBut I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the\u2014my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are\u2014we've provided for the number of\u2014we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America\u2014very complicated stuff.\nIt's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between\u2014we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.\nAnd there's a lot of other\u2014for example, the idea that we're\u2014in terms of taxes\u2014that they refuse to\u2014for example, we\u2014I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill\u2014anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.\nAnd\u2014because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty\u2014$400 billion\u2014or $40 billion\u2014$400 billion\u2014that they\u2014they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, \"You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes.\" What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.\nAnd so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.\nAnd like I said, we're now down to\u2014we went from somewhere\u2014roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.\nSo my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table. And so that's what I continue\u2014we continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.\nNational Economy/The President's Economic Agenda/Federal Budget Negotiations  ",

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You recently launched your reelection campaign. You've said questions about your age are \"legitimate.\" And your response is always, \"Just watch me.\" But the country is watching, and recent polling shows that 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, believe you shouldn't run again. What do you say to them? What do you say to those Americans who are watching and aren't convinced?\nYou've said you can beat Trump again. Do you think you're the only one?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Biden. I may not be the only one, but I know him well. And I know the danger he presents to our democracy. And we've been down this road before.\nAnd with regard to age, you know, and polling data, I noticed the polling data I keep hearing about is that I'm between 42 and 46 percent favorable rating, et cetera. And\u2014but everybody running for reelection in this time has been in the same position. There's nothing new about that. You're making it sound like \"Biden is really underwater.\" And\u2014number one.\nNumber two, when the same polling data asks whether they think\u2014what kind of job I've done, it gets overwhelmingly positive results, from 58 percent thinking everything from the CHIPS Act and the\u2014all the things we've done.\nYou know, we've created\u2014like I said, we've created 12 million new jobs. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have economic growth moving. We're in a situation where the climate\u2014we've invested more money and more help in dealing with the climate crisis than any nation in the world.\nAnd so, things are moving. And the reason I'm running again is there's a job to finish.\nThe other thing is that\u2014look, you know, think about what I inherited when I got elected. I inherited a nation in overwhelming debt at the time, number one\u2014in the hole for the 4 years that he was President.\nI inherited a nation that had a serious loss of credibility around the world as \"America First\" and\u2014\u2014\nYou know, the first meeting I attended\u2014the G-7\u2014I said, \"American is back.\" And one of the world leaders looked and said: \"For how long? For how long?\" There was a great concern about the United States being able to lead the free world. And we're doing that again.\nAnd those same polls you look at\u2014you take a look at the polls that are saying whether I pulled together NATO and the European Union, as well as the Asian partners. I think we have. But there's more to do.\nAnd with regard to age, I can't even say\u2014if I guess how old I am, I can't even say the number. It doesn't\u2014it doesn't register with me.\nAnd\u2014but the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out\u2014they're going to see a race, and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I'd take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.\nAnd I feel good. I feel excited about the prospects. And I think we're on the verge of really turning the corner in a way we haven't in a long time.\nI know you're tired of hearing me say we're at an inflection point, but we really are. What happens in the next 2, 3, 4 years is going to determine what the next three or four decades look like. And I have never been more optimistic in my life about the possibilities of the United States. ",

    "question": "\nQ. Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Mr. Prime Minister. I'd like to ask a question about Roxham Road. The agreement has been ready for a year. Why did you wait so long?\nAnd for the 15,000 migrants that Canada will welcome, why so few? What have we offered to the U.S. in exchange?\nPrime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Christian. We've known for a long time theoretically what modernization needed to be made to the Roxham Road, to the agreement. We couldn't simply shut down Roxham Road and hope that everything would resolve itself, because we would have had problems. The border is very long. People would have looked for other places to cross.\nAnd so that's why we chose to modernize the Safe Third Country Agreement so that someone who attempts to cross between official crossings will be subject to the principle\u2014the same principle as someone who should seek asylum in the first safe country they arrive at.\nNow, for people who are coming from the U.S., that is where they should be asylum seekers, using this means of uniformly applying the agreement, which we knew theoretically would be the solution, but it takes complex processes to manage the border. It took months before we could move forward with the announcement. But by doing so, we protected the integrity of the system. And we're also continuing to live up to our obligations with respect to asylum seekers.\nAt the same time, we continue to be open to regular migrants, and we will increase the number of asylum seekers who we accept from the hemisphere\u2014the Western Hemisphere\u2014in order to compensate for closing these irregular crossings.\nThank you.\nHaiti \n[The reporter spoke in English as follows.] \nQ. Mr. President, this question is for you, but Mr. Trudeau\u2014\u2014\n[The reporter continued in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPlease feel free, Mr. Trudeau, to answer as well.\nAre you disappointed that Canada is not part or hasn't taken a bigger role in the multilateral forces in Haiti? And what would you like Canada to do more, in addition to the $100 million announced today?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Biden. Well, no, I'm not disappointed. Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in Haiti, where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run\u2014they rule the roost, as the saying goes.\nAnd so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in Haiti having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.\nWe also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in Haiti, and the diaspora could cause some real\u2014how can I say it?\u2014confusion in the Western Hemisphere.\nAnd so\u2014but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some. So it's a work in progress.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Trudeau. For 30 years, Western countries have been involved in Haiti to try to stabilize the country, to try to help the Pearl of the Antilles. And the situation is atrocious. It's affecting the security of the people of Haiti. We must take action.\nAnd we must keep the Haitian people in the approach that we build for security. And that's why the approach that we are working on with the U.S. involves strengthening the capacity of the Haitian National Police, bringing more peace and security and stability. This won't happen tomorrow. It will, of course, be a long process, but we will be there to support the capacity of the police in Haiti, the National Police.\nAt the same time, part of the insecurity and instability in Haiti is because of the Haitian elite, who have for too long benefited from the misery of the Haitian people. They work for their own political gain, their own personal gain. And this has prevented the country from recovering. And that's why we're proceeding with sanctions. We will continue to bring pressure to bear on the elite, the political class in Haiti, to hold them accountable for the distress facing the Haitian people, but to hold them accountable for ensuring their well-being.\nWe're going to continue to work together. We fully understand how important this task is.\n",

    "question": "\nQ. On fentanyl? On fentanyl and energy consultations?",
    "answer": "\nPresident L\u00f3pez Obrador. Yes, we are doing that. Just as I was telling you that in the case of migration, first there were brothers and sisters from Central America and also from Mexico, but now, in recent times, a lot of migrants from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador.\nWe do have a situation. This is a\u2014these are changes in places where we're\u2014places where people are being pushed to leave their towns, their place of origin for many reasons.\nAnd with drugs, we have a case in point. It is not cannabis. It's not marijuana. It's not poppies\u2014poppy. It's not only cocaine either. Now, we have fentanyl and chemicals, which are some of the most dangerous type of substance and very harmful for people because they are causing so many deaths.\nSo then, we're working on this in an organized manner. In the case of Mexico, this led us to make all the ports in the customs offices to be controlled by the armed forces in Mexico, all the sea customs office, because fentanyl and other chemicals come from Asia, and they are processed in labs. And we are avoiding the entrance of those chemical substances, and we are destroying labs.\nThe Navy Secretariat is in charge of managing ports and customs\u2014sea customs offices. For instance, we had so much trafficking of chemicals in the port of Manzanillo and also in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Now, the Navy is in charge of controlling those customs.\nAnd all the customs, the land customs offices along the border line are now under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense\u2014National Defense Ministry.\nSo we are combating fentanyl and those chemicals, and we're doing this because we care. Nothing human is alien to us. We truly care being able to help and to be of help\u2014the situation in the United States\u2014deaths because of overdose of fentanyl.\nAnd\u2014but just as we discussed today, this is not only an issue of the United States. The thing is that if we do not face this problem, this scourge, we are going to suffer it ourselves as well. So we have to act in a coordinated fashion. And that is something we have been doing, and we discussed it in this summit. It is in the communique we are about to give you. And we are defending life\u2014the life.\nAs I was telling you\u2014I was telling Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden\u2014their teams, I was telling them as well: We only have two campaigns\u2014publicity or propaganda campaigns\u2014in the Government, in my administration. One is dedicated or devoted to not consuming drugs: \"Say no to drugs.\" Because we have to also think of that. It became quite a famous thing\u2014public fame. Everything related to gangs. They are even series of gangs and organized crime\u2014gangs of organized crimes.\nAnd this is like an apology of that which is desirable, because there are residences, very rich homes in those series, very luxurious homes, and the cars. Men and women\u2014all very good looking\u2014very handsome men and women well dressed with jewelry all over the place, with a lot of power. And they pick up the phone, and they call the head of the police force, head of the military, or even a President of a country. And that's what's being disseminated all over.\nBut we have seen a series on the damage caused by fentanyl, how, in 6 months, the life of a young person is destroyed. And what those doses contain, they have muriatic acid. Do people inform about the situation? Do people let other people know about this? No, of course not. So we are going to be launching an information campaign.\nAs I was telling the President and the Prime Minister, I said vapers\u2014yes, they say: \"Well, they're not bad. I mean, they just have five substances. That's it. But they're not bad.\"\nWe did some research on this. Over 30 substances, harmful and cancer-causing substances in those devices people smoke with. However, because of the lobbying, corruption as well, the publicity or advertising management, then\u2014this is being allowed.\nAnd there are many parents and mothers, fathers who don't even know the damage that their\u2014our children are going through because of vapors. We have to look into this.\nBut, really, this is not only the responsibility of the Government, this is also the responsibility of the media. You can also help us so much on this to, you know, spread the word, to inform people. Radio stations, television networks\u2014they should be devoting time for this to inform people, to guide people on this on how bad drugs can be for people's health and that people can be successful and they can be happy without having, without needing to fall into drug addiction, those mortal traps.\nWell, all this, that's what we've been discussing. I think I'm taking more than the time that I should have taken. It's cold outside.\nThank you so much, everyone. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you so much. \nPresident Biden. I want the record to show: I don't know what questions I didn't answer. I'm prepared later. Thank you very much. [Laughter]\n ",

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I will have a question for you and one for the French President, if I may.\nFor you, first, you now are saying that you are going to better coordinate, especially your green economic policies. But yesterday Emmanuel Macron said that the Inflation Reduction Act is, in fact, \"superaggressive,\" I quote, toward European companies. Does that mean that you are ready to grant exception\u2014exemptions of the regulations to European industries?\nAnd now my question to you, Monsieur President.\n[The reporter spoke in French, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nMr. President, will you leave Washington with the assurance that you will be able to deal with these massive\u2014[inaudible]?\nInterpreter. The journalist doesn't have a microphone. \nQ. Do you think there is risk of generating divisions?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Biden. I'll answer the last question, since I didn't hear any of it. I didn't understand a word of it, so I'll answer it. [Laughter]\n[President Macron spoke briefly in English as follows.] \nPresident Macron. Can we take care of it? [Laughter] \nPresident Biden. No, look, the United States makes no apology\u2014and I make no apologies, since I wrote it for\u2014the legislation you're talking about.\nBut there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation\u2014and that has almost $368 billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all\u2014of all of history. And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it.\nFor example, there's a provision in it that says that there is the exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. Well, that was added by a Member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just meant allies; he didn't mean, literally, free trade agreement. So there's a lot we can work out.\nBut the essence of it is, we're going to make sure that the United States continues\u2014and just as I hope Europe will be able to continue\u2014not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain. We're\u2014we are our own supply chain, and we share that with Europe and all of our allies. And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing.\nSo there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and/or be on their own. But that is something that is a matter to be worked out.\nThere is no fundamental\u2014it was never intended, when I wrote the legislation\u2014I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us. That was not the intention.\nThe intention was to make sure we no longer were in a position\u2014when there was a pandemic in Asia, and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. We invented the damn things, you know? [Laughter]\nSo it's\u2014anyway\u2014but my point is, we're back in business, Europe is back in business, and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] \nPresident Macron. What we've been discussing with President Biden and what, as a matter of fact, he just said\u2014and that's what I talked about with the caucus yesterday\u2014that simple: The United States of America adopted a piece of legislation for their country, for their industry, which\u2014with a common objective, goal that we share: creating jobs, creating opportunities for the middle class, and succeeding in implementing the energy transition.\nThe reality is that the consequences, as we've seen in our discussions\u2014it is certainly not the intention of the United States, but, as a matter of fact, projects that were growing\u2014being developed in Europe, there's such a difference in subsidies that these projects might come to an end.\nAnd a number of Senators, yesterday, like\u2014said it was certainly not their intention. So France simply did not come to ask for an exemption or another for our economy, but simply to discuss the consequences of this legislation.\nAnd the news\u2014the circumstances mean that we have no alternative, but to work together. So, therefore, I believe we need to resynchronize, as I say, find a new policy to clarify our goals and continue together. And the discussion we had this morning was extremely clear. And I could feel the very same intent on behalf of the Members of the Congress yesterday.\nAnd the wish of President Biden is to rebuild a strong industry here and to have somehow to secure some technology solutions for the future. France wishes exactly the same thing for itself. And we're\u2014we've been fighting, day in, day out, to do the very same thing in our country. And this will enable us to put an end to some 15 years of industry loss in our country and to have new manufacturing jobs.\nAnd so we'll be working on that. And we decided to do that together with the other members of the European Union and the European Commission. So we will work on the technical elements to make sure that there is no domino effect on ongoing projects in Europe. We want to succeed together, not one against the other.\nIt's been clear. This is the outcome of our discussions this morning. And this is exactly the philosophy that I share, and it is the one that we need.\nFrance-U.S. Relations \n[A reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] ",

    "question": "\nQ. You mentioned that Americans are frustrated. And, in fact, 75 percent of voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, despite the results of last night. What in the next 2 years do you intend to do differently to change people's opinion of the direction of the country, particularly as you contemplate a run for President in 2024?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. Nothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is.\nDo you know anybody who wants us to get rid of the change we made on prescription drug prices and raise prices again? Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and the internet and so on? I don't know any\u2014I think that the problem is, the major pieces of legislation we passed\u2014and some of it bipartisan\u2014takes time to be recognized.\nFor example, you've got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in\u2014up in Scranton, Pennsylvania\u2014the Congressman who got elected. And he said, \"Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York\u2014New York City?\" I said: \"Yes, we can. We can.\"\nFirst of all, it will make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there\u2014we voted for\u2014than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with.\nAnd it's the same way\u2014for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year.\nSo there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving.\nSo I'm not going to change\u2014as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I wanted to change and add to. For example, we've\u2014had passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation\u2014you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And\u2014but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil\u2014so I'm not going to change the direction.\nI said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm\u2014and I know\u2014I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay?\nOne is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are starting\u2014the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more\u2014more\u2014how can I say it?\u2014decent.\nSecond thing I said was, I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hard-working folks.\nAnd the third thing\u2014I know is still very hard\u2014I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country. It's hard to sustain yourself as a leading democracy in the world if you can't generate some unity.\nSo I'm not going to change anything in any fundamental way.\nRussia/Ukraine  ",

And you've come to this summit here and the one in Germany after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned constitutional protections for abortion, after the shootings in Buffalo and Texas, at a time of record inflation, and as new polling this week shows that 85 percent of the U.S. public thinks the country is going in the wrong direction.\nHow do you explain this to those people who feel the country is going in the wrong direction, including some of the leaders you've been meeting with this week, who think that when you put all of this together, it amounts to an America that is going backward?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. They do not think that. You haven't found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards. America is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world. The one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States on overruling not only Roe v. Wade, but essentially challenging the right to privacy.\nWe've been a leader in the world in terms of personal rights and privacy rights, and it is a mistake, in my view, for the Supreme Court to do what it did.\nBut I have not seen anyone come up to me and do anything other than\u2014nor have you heard them say anything other than: \"Thank you for America's leadership. You've changed the dynamic of NATO and the G-7.\"\nSo I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of what the Supreme Court did. I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of inflation. But inflation is higher in almost every other country. Prices at the pump are higher in almost every other country. We're better positioned to deal with this than anyone, but we have a way to go.\nAnd the Supreme Court\u2014we have to change that decision by codifying Roe v.

Prime Minister, President Biden, thank you very much.\nFirst, to Prime Minister: With the Russian aggression of Ukraine, Prime Minister, you've been saying that security of Europe and security of the Indo-Pacific are inseparable. In today's meeting, did you talk about response to China? How did you analyze the current status of the cross-Straits relations? Did the Japanese side or U.S. side explain how U.S. would respond in times of contingency? What was the request from the U.S. side regarding Japanese response to a contingency in cross-Straits situation? Did you explain the defense budget increase or enemy base strike capability? What did you explain in that context, Prime Minister?\nPrime Minister Kishida. Well, thank you for your question. First of all, at today's summit meeting, as regards Taiwan Strait issue that you asked, we confirmed that basic stances of two countries on Taiwan remains to be unchanged and underscored the importance of peace and stability of Taiwan Strait, which is an indispensable element for security and prosperity of international community, and called upon peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.\nWell, in the region, security-related environment is getting severer. Unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force, like Russia's aggression against Ukraine this time, should never be tolerated in Indo-Pacific. Above all, in East Asia, it's indispensable to further strengthen Japan-U.S. alliance.\nBased on this shared awareness, I have said that\u2014fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capability. And I stated my determination to fundamentally reinforce Japan's defense capabilities and secure substantial increase of its defense budget needed to effect it. And President Biden strongly supported my determination.\nAnd also from myself, I have said that includes what is called \"enemy base strike capability.\" All the options will be there, not to exclude any one of them. And this is what I said to President in Indo-Pacific region, as well as to ensure the peace and prosperity of the international community, the basis is the cornerstone of which is Japan-U.S. alliance. And toward the further strengthening of the alliance, we would like to remain in close coordination between Japan and the United States.\nThank you.\nModerator. Thank you very much.\nU.S. Economy/Foreign Investment in U.S. Manufacturing/Gasoline Prices/Inflation  \nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for Prime Minister Kishida as well. But, Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the economy. During your trip here to Asia, you've promoted the investments by Samsung and Hyundai. But back home in the United States, Americans are dealing with record-high inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates to try to address those issues. And there are also just enormously high gas prices.\nGiven the cross-currents of the economy right now\u2014the war in Ukraine, the China lockdowns that we've seen\u2014should Americans be prepared for a recession?

What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?\nAnd in addition to that, you talked about universal values\u2014solidarity and alliance\u2014and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values\u2014for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries\u2014do you think you can take\u2014resort to those measures as well?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Yoon. As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.\nLet's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced\u2014for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had\u2014[inaudible]\u2014water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.\nAnd to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.\nAnd in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.\nAnd especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.\nThe NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.\nIn addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.\nThis is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words\u2014empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.\nAnd the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.\nSo, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.\n",

In a few hours from now, the Senate\u2014an effort in the Senate to deal with voting rights and voting\u2014voting reform legislation is going to fail. COVID-19 is taking the lives of 1,500 Americans every day. And the Nation's divisions are just as raw as they were a year ago. Did you overpromise to the American public what you could achieve in your first year in office? And how do you plan to course-correct going forward?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. Why are you such an optimist? [Laughter]\nLook, I didn't overpromise, and\u2014but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress. You mentioned the number of deaths from COVID; well, it was three times that not long ago. It's coming down. Everything is changing. It's getting better.\nLook, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.\nBut one of the things that I think is something that\u2014one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day\u2014and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him\u2014a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to\u2014excuse me, Governor Sununu\u2014when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.\nHere's what he said: \"They were all, for the most\"\u2014quote\u2014\"They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do,\" Sununu said.\nHe went on to say, \"It bothered me that they were okay with that.\" And then he goes on to say, \"I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back\"\u2014\"if we win the White House back.\" \"Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018?\" And then, he said\u2014how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: \"Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.\"\nI did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.\nAnd so the problem here is that I think what happens\u2014what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.\nRemember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that\u2014you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when\u2014that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole\u2014I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.\nAnd I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: \"Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that.\" And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.\nAnd one of the things that I remember saying\u2014and I'll end this\u2014I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act\u2014I said, \"You ought to take a victory lap.\" And he said, \"There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.\"\nAs a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.\nAnd so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.\nYou know, one of the things that I remember\u2014and I'll end this with\u2014I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said\u2014and when he would endorse me\u2014and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access\u2014access\u2014to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that. We can't afford not to do it.\nSo I tell my Republican friends: Here I come. This is going to be about, \"What are you for?\"\u2014\"What are you for?\"\u2014and lay out what we're for.\nMary Bruce, ABC.\nThe President's Legislative Agenda  ",

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You noted your disappointment with Chinese actions on climate in Rome and also the lack of willingness for Chinese President Xi Jinping to show up at either the G-20 or COP26.\nBut I wanted to ask more broadly: When you assess where things stand right now in U.S.-China relationships after your first 10 months in office\u2014your diplomats have had difficulty engaging in a substantive manner with some of their counterparts; you have a Chinese military that has tested a hypersonic missile this summer and is building its nuclear capability\u2014what is your general assessment of where things stand? And are you concerned that the potential for armed conflict has grown over the course of your first 10 months in office?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. Well, let me start off by addressing the first part of\u2014if not the question, the statement. And that is that I indicated that China and Russia not showing up\u2014and Saudi Arabia\u2014was a problem. We showed up. We showed up. And by showing up, we've had a profound impact on the way I think the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role.\nI think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China\u2014with respect to China not showing up. The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, \"What value added are they providing?\" And they've lost an ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP\u2014the same way, I would argue, with regard to Russia.\nWith regard to the more profound question about do I\u2014am I worried about an armed conflict or some\u2014that accidentally occurring with China: No, I'm not. But I have had, as I've said before\u2014and I think we've talked about this, Phil, but I may be mistaken\u2014that I think, as I've said, I look at China\u2014and I've had hours of conversations with Xi Jinping, both in person when I was Vice President and since I've been President, at least 5 or 6 hours' worth of conversations on the telephone, and I'm going to be having a virtual summit with him\u2014I've made it clear: This does\u2014this is competition; it does not have to be conflict. There is no reason there needs to be conflict.\nBut I've also indicated to him, and I've\u2014so I don't\u2014I'm not reluctant to say it publicly\u2014that we expect him to play by the rules of the road. We're not going to change our attitude toward what constitutes international airspace, international sea lanes, et cetera.\nWe also have made it clear that we have to work on dealing with things like cybersecurity and a whole range of other issues. But I'm not looking for, I don't anticipate there will be a need for\u2014to be\u2014there be physical conflict. But you know, as you've heard me say this before\u2014my dad had an expression. He'd say, \"The only conflict worse than the one that's intended is one that's unintended\"\u2014one that's unintended.\nAnd so, in my meetings with him virtually coming up\u2014we haven't set the exact date yet\u2014I want to make sure there's no misunderstanding. It's competition, not conflict. And so there's no\u2014no unintended.\nYes, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].\nThe President's Economic Agenda/Senator Joseph A. Manchin III  ",

Your party spent months trying to negotiate the centerpiece of your Democrat\u2014of your domestic legislative agenda.\nWe're 1 year now since your election. What\u2014and you have done a lot in your year in office to try to turn the page on the last administration. But we've seen how Presidents can turn the page very quickly from one to the other.

But that's not why I ran. I didn't run to determine how well I'm going to do in the polls.

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you and then some for Chancellor Merkel as well. Your administration, tomorrow, is issuing a business advisory for Hong Kong. I was wondering if you can explain why you think that is necessary.\nAnd then, secondly, on your Build Back Better agenda, have you spoken to Senators Manchin and Sinema about the $3.5 trillion framework, and are you confident that they'll be on board at that level? And if they demand that you lose some components, will you be able to keep progressives on board?\n[At this point, the reporter spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nI wanted to ask you whether you have a feeling that, after the talk with President Biden, he better understands your viewpoint as regards China or whether the situation is still tense, whether there is still decoupling. And secondly, whether you think that the United States has contributed enough to vaccinate the rest of the world, or do you think it's only\u2014is it appropriate for children in the United States being vaccinated\u2014children below the age of 12, while adults in other countries have no chance to get vaccinated?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Biden. That's all? [Laughter] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.\nLet me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in\u2014on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.\nWith regard to \"am I confident?\"\u2014I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms\u2014[laughter]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.\nI don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten\u2014we've each committed\u2014I trust the members of\u2014the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.\nWith regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience\u2014but reconciliation\u2014that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.\nToday\u2014I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get\u2014if you're making less than $150,000\u2014you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get\u2014in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth\u201412 months divided\u2014$3,600\u2014$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty\u2014child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.\nWe have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who\u2014what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.\nThank you.\nChancellor Merkel. We talked about China, and there is a lot of common understanding that China, in many areas, is our competitor; that trade with China needs to rest on the assumption that we have a level playing field so that we all play by the same rules, have the same standards. That, incidentally, was also the driving force behind the EU-China agreement on trade that they abide by the core labor norms of ILO.\nAnd we are convinced of ours\u2014needing to be technological leaders for our two countries in many, many areas. Obviously, it's legitimate for China wishing to do this as well, but, for\nexample, we will cooperate in many technological state-of-the-art technologies, for example, CHIPS. I think the act that the President launched is fundamental in this respect and crucial.\nAnd we want to trade together at a time of digitalization where security issues loom very large in our agendas. We ought to have an exchange on this; we ought to talk about this; we ought to talk about norms, standards that govern the internet; whether we can agree on common norms. I think, particularly as regards to the relationship of us with China, we ought to coordinate our efforts. We do that in the European Union, and we should do it with the United States.\nAnd then, there are interests, obviously: sometimes divergent interests, but sometimes common interests. But we also have, obviously, areas where American companies compete with European companies, and we have to accept that. But I think, basically, the rules as to how we deal with China ought to rest and do rest on our shared values.\nAnd I think, on the pandemic, we are obviously of the opinion that the pandemic\u2014we can only master the pandemic if each and every one is vaccinated. We are trying to boost production. We are trying also to get as many people in our country vaccinated as possible\u2014which obviously opens us up to criticism of those countries who as yet have not had the chance, which is why we invested a lot of money in COVAX, which is why we encourage our companies to increase their production of vaccines.\nAnd, in Africa, we are trying to help Africans to upskill people so that they, too, can have their own production sites. We're going to do this, but, de facto, there is an imbalance, I agree. And\u2014but we're overcoming. We're putting our all into that and also together in overcoming that imbalance.\nI'm sorry. I call on Ms. Sch\u00e4uble from Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. Thank you.\n[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]\nU.S. Travel Restrictions on European Union Member Countries  ",

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, sir. U.S. intelligence has said that Russia tried to interfere in the last two Presidential elections, and that Russia groups are behind hacks like SolarWinds and some of the ransomware attacks you just mentioned. Putin, in his news conference just now, accepted no responsibility for any misbehavior. Your predecessor opted not to demand that Putin stop these disruptions. So what is something concrete, sir, that you achieved today to prevent that from happening again? And what were the consequences you threatened?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. Whether I stopped it from happening again\u2014he knows I will take action, like we did when\u2014this last time out. What happened was: We, in fact, made it clear that we were not going to continue to allow this to go on. The end result was, we ended up withdrawing\u2014they went withdrawing Ambassadors, and we closed down some of their facilities in the United States, et cetera. And he knows there are consequences.\nNow, look, one of the consequences that I know\u2014I don't know; I shouldn't say this; it's unfair of me\u2014I suspect you may all think doesn't matter, but I'm confidence it matters to him\u2014confident it matters to him and other world leaders of big nations: his credibility worldwide shrinks.\nLet's get this straight: How would it be if the United States were viewed by the rest of the world as interfering with the elections directly of other countries, and everybody knew it? What would it be like if we engaged in activities that he is engaged in? It diminishes the standing of a country that is desperately trying to make sure it maintains its standing as a major world power.\nAnd so it's not just what I do, it's what the actions that other countries take\u2014in this case, Russia\u2014that are contrary to international norms. It's the price they pay. They are not\u2014they are not\u2014able to dictate what happens in the world.

Mr. President, Vladimir Putin\u2014\u2014\n[At this point, a microphone was brought to Mr. Lemire.] \nQ. \u2014\u2014thank you. Vladimir Putin, who you'll be seeing in a few days in Geneva, said just a couple of days ago that he believed that U.S.-Russia relations were at a low point. In what concrete ways could your summit change that?\nAnd then, secondly, on the same topic: You have said previously, and in the runup to the summit, that you would be unafraid to call out Russia's disruptive actions\u2014like cyber hacks, Ukraine, election interference\u2014but you're not having a joint press conference with Putin. Why not take the chance to stand side by side with him and say those things to him with the world watching?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. [Laughter] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.\nAs I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was\u2014I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the\u2014a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.\nI did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.\nWith regard to\u2014I always found\u2014and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know\u2014but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other. It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are\u2014with Russia.\nWe're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.\nSo the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward\u2014[laughter]\u2014with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he'll make clear how\u2014from his perspective, how it turned out.\nBut I don't want to get into being diverted by: \"Did they shake hands? How far did they\u2014who talked the most,\" and the rest. Now, he can say what he said the meeting was about, and I will say what I think the meeting was about.\nThat's how I'm going to handle it.

I would not give him all that he's looking for is: national\u2014international recognition as legitimate and say\u2014and give them what allowed him to move in the direction of appearing to be more\u2014how can I say it?\u2014more serious about what he wasn't at all serious about.\nI'd have to know specifics.

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, in your last press conference, you said successful Presidents prioritize and that you were focusing your agenda on one thing at a time. And I'd like to just ask you: What would you say to many Americans who voted for you about the legislative progress on gun control and police reform having to wait while you pursue infrastructure, given that we continue to see these incidents with mass shootings and also police-involved shootings, including the incident that a lot of us saw in Chicago most recently? Do you feel any need to reprioritize your agenda?",
    "answer": "\nPresident Biden. I've never not prioritized this. No one has worked harder to deal with the violence used by individuals using weapons than I have. I'm the only one ever to have passed an assault weapons ban. I'm the only one that ever got a 10-year ban on assault weapons and clips of more than 10 bullets.\nImmediately upon us becoming in office, having an Attorney General, I asked him to put together the things I could do by Executive order, including dealing with new guns that can be made\u2014you can buy in pieces and put together, and other initiatives.\nI strongly support\u2014I strongly support\u2014the universal background checks, which I continue to push. The Congress has to step up and act. The Senate has to act. And I strongly support and continue\u2014I've never stopped supporting the ban on assault weapons and magazines that hold more than 10 bullets.\nIt doesn't mean that I can't also be working at the same time on the economy and on COVID. But it's not a question of my being able to set the agenda in the Senate as to what they will move to first. And so I continue and I strongly, strongly urge my Republican friends in the Congress who even refused to bring up the House-passed bill to bring it up now.\nThis has to end. It's a national embarrassment. It is a national embarrassment what's going on. And it's not only these mass shootings that are occurring. Every single day\u2014every single day, there's a mass shooting in this United\u2014in the United States if you count all those who are killed out on the streets of our cities and our rural areas. It's a national embarrassment and must come to an end.\nAnd one last thing: The folks who own weapons, the folks who own guns, they support universal background checks. The majority of them think we should not be selling assault weapons. Who, in God's name, needs a weapon that can hold 100 rounds or 40 rounds or 20 rounds? It's just wrong. And I'm not going to give up until it's done.\nYou have a question you want to offer? I mean, not a question\u2014[laughter]\u2014recognize someone, Mr. Prime Minister.\nPrime Minister Suga.

    "question": "\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I'd like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your Presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?",
    "answer": "\nThe President. Well, I'm going to\u2014look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning\u2014there are a lot of problems\u2014put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.\nAnd the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and\u2014whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're not going to be\u2014they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.\nSo we're going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that's the reason why I focused as I have.\nAnd here's the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I'm not going to do that; I'm just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\nEconomic Stimulus and Pandemic Relief Legislation  ",
